# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

You have to create a simple React App which has a reusable Card Component which has the following

Ability to pass in props to the Component
The Card must show a person's
Name
A short description
LinkedIn, Twitter and other Social Media Handle buttons
Interests Section
You can assume that this is kind of an e-business card and feel free to put in your creativity
Additional & Slightly advanced:
Create a page where you can add these kind of Cards by taking input from the user
Create a backend server where these cards get stored in a DB and can handle basic CRUD operations
Give the feature to perform CRUD operations from the frontend (Can be restricted to the admin only as well)
