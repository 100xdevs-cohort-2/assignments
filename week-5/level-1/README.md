You have to create a simple React App which has a reusable Card Component which has the following
 - Ability to pass in props to the Component
 - The Card must show a person's
    - Name
    - A short description
    - LinkedIn, Twitter and other Social Media Handle buttons
    - Interests Section
 - You can assume that this is kind of an e-business card and feel free to put in your creativity
 - Additional & Slightly advanced:
    - Create a page where you can add these kind of Cards by taking input from the user
    - Create a backend server where these cards get stored in a DB and can handle basic CRUD operations
    - Give the feature to perform CRUD operations from the frontend (Can be restricted to the admin only as well)
