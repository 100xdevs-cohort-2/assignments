// We have already covered this in the second lesson, but as an easy recap try to code a counter in Javascript
// It should go up as time goes by in intervals of 1 second

const d = new Date();

const start = d.getSeconds();
const end = d.getSeconds();

console.log(start);

// let i = 0;
// while(end <= start + 1){
//     i++;
//     console.log(i);
// }
