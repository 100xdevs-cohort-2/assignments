Subscription
Used to create and use Azure services
Created for you when you sign up
📝 Logical container used to provision resources in Azure such as virtual machines, databases and more.
📝 When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to
As you use the VM, the usage of the VM is aggregated and billed monthly.
📝 Each subscription is a separate entity that can't be merged.
Multiple Azure Subscriptions
You can create new subscriptions to separate e.g.
Environments
E.g. for testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
💡Useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
Organizational structures
E.g. limit a team to lower-cost resources & allow IT department a full range
💡Allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription
Billing
Costs are first aggregated at the subscription level
Manage and track costs based on your needs
E.g. for production, development, testing
Or due to subscription limits:
Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations
E.g. the maximum number of Express Route circuits per subscription is 10
Billing
You'll receive a monthly invoice with payment instructions provided
You also can get set up for multiple invoices.
Customize billing
Allows you to e.g. have single invoice for organization but organize charges by department, team, or project.
Billing structure:
Azure billing structure
Each billing account has billing profile
Each billing profile has different invoice sections
Each invoice section can be coupled to different subscriptions.
Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month
