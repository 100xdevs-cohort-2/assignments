Try to bootstrap a basic React application using vite.
Read more about vite here - https://vitejs.dev/

Create the following functionality -

- A basic TODO application where there are two input (title and description) boxes and users can add append TODOs to a div
- Try using the same DOM functionality we did in week 4. Don't try to use state variables in React just yet
- Just tro to port over our original HTML/JS impelementation over to a React project
- Hard todo - If you can, try using `useState` that we discussed this week and propogate the TODOs using state (If you don't understand this, dont worry about it)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
