Does Async await block the main thread? because if you will write any console.log() statement after awaiting a promise it will wait for the promise to get resolved and then moves to next line. How it is happening?
-In JavaScript, async functions and the await keyword do not block the main thread. When you use await within an async function, it pauses the execution of that function until the promise is resolved or rejected. However, during this time, the event loop is free to continue processing other tasks, so it doesn't block the main thread.This behavior allows asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous style, making it easier to read and reason about. The console.log() statement you mentioned doesn't block the main thread; it's just part of the asynchronous flow, and it will be executed when the promise is resolved, allowing the program to continue its execution afterward.
Firstly when the execution of that async function started and it is brought in the call stack then it for example console.log something and then await keyword is there which is resolving some promise so at this point what is the status of call stack ? assume there is no other synchronous code outside this async function.
Also if Async/Await is only a syntactic sugar over .then() approach of resolving promises which means await keyword must be using the .then() approach behind the scenes but in resolving a promise through .then approach does not wait for the promise to get resolved but it keeps on executing the other lines and gives the data of promise at last once the promise is in fulfilled state.
When an async function is called, it returns a promise right? 
 The code inside the async function is executed  in a sync until an await keyword is encountered. When an await is reached, the function is paused, and the control is returned to the event loop, allowing other tasks to be processed.
HENCE: 
During the time the async function is paused, the call stack is essentially empty. Other asynchronous tasks or events can be processed by the event loop during this time.
