/**
  You need to create an express HTTP server in Node.js which will handle the logic of a file server.
  - Use built in Node.js `fs` module

  The expected API endpoints are defined below,
  1. GET /files - Returns a list of files present in `./files/` directory
    Response: 200 OK with an array of file names in JSON format.
    Example: GET http://localhost:3000/files

  2. GET /file/:filename - Returns content of given file by name
     Description: Use the filename from the request path parameter to read the file from `./files/` directory
     Response: 200 OK with the file content as the response body if found, or 404 Not Found if not found. Should return `File not found` as text if file is not found
     Example: GET http://localhost:3000/file/example.txt

    - For any other route not defined in the server return 404

    Testing the server - run `npm run test-fileServer` command in terminal
